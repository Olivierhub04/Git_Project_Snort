*SNORT* 
is an open-source network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS) developed by Cisco. 
It is designed to detect and prevent a wide range of attacks and malicious activities by analyzing network traffic in real time. 

Here are some key features and characteristics of Snort:

### KEY FEATURES

- *Real-Time Traffic Analysis*: Snort captures and analyzes packets in real time, enabling immediate detection of suspicious activities.

- *Protocol Analysis*: It understands various network protocols, allowing it to inspect and interpret traffic accurately.

- *Signature-Based Detection*: Snort uses a set of predefined rules to identify known attack patterns. 
Users can also create custom rules for specific needs.

- *Flexible Deployment*: Snort can be deployed in various modes, including:
*Sniffer Mode*: Captures and displays packet data.
*Packet Logger Mode*: Logs packets to disk for later analysis.
*Network Intrusion Detection System Mode*: Analyzes traffic and raises alerts based on rule matches.

The five basic rule types in Snort are:
-Alert rules: Snort generates an alert when a suspicious packet is detected.
-Block rules: Snort blocks the suspicious packet and all subsequent packets in the network flow.
-Drop rules: Snort drops the packet as soon as the alert is generated.
-Logging rules: Snort logs the packet as soon as the alert is generated.
-Pass rules: Snort ignores the suspicious packet and marks it as passed.
